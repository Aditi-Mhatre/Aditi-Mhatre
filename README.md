I'm a Computer Science Master's student with a deep passion for all things tech. I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve complex problems. As an aspiring technologist, I'm constantly learning and honing my skills. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about everything from mystery novels to sociology and listening to music. Let's connect and build something amazing!
